# Phone Bill Calculator
A simple phone bill calculator that I coded for a class project. Feel free to use this code if you've been assigned the same prompt.

Prompt:

The Dash Cell Phone Company charges customers a basic rate of $5 per month to send text messages. Additional rates are as follows:

The first 100 messages per month, regardless of message length, are included in the basic bill.
An additional three cents are charged for each text message after the 100th message, up to and including 300 messages.
An additional two cents are charged for each text message after the 300th message.
Federal, state, and local taxes add a total of 14 percent to each bill.
Write a program that accepts the following data about one customer's messages: area code (three digits), phone number (seven digits), and number of text messages sent. Display all the data, including the month-end bill both before and after taxes are added.
